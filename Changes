Revision history for Test-WWW-Mechanize

WWW::Mechanize and Test::WWW::Mechanize do not use rt.cpan.org for
bug tracking.  They are now being tracked via Google Code at
http://code.google.com/p/www-mechanize/issues/list

NEXT
------------------------------------
[FIXED]
Description of error in $mech->content_unlike() was wrong.

Now requires newer Test::LongString.

[INTERNALS]
Hoisted common code out of get_ok, post_ok, etc.

[DOCUMENTATION]
Updated copyright and licensing information.



1.24    Sat Jan 17 13:26:47 CST 2009
------------------------------------
Tests run on port 13432 instead of 8080.  It should really be a
random open port, but for now, something other than 8080 will do.


1.23_01 Mon Dec 22 17:43:46 CST 2008
------------------------------------
[FIXED]
Tests would fail because we weren't unsetting http_proxy.

Fixed many failed tests.  Overhauled the test server setup.


[ENHANCEMENTS]
Added autolinting capability, so you can do this:

    my $mech = Test::WWW::Mechanize->new( autolint => 1 );
    $mech->get_ok( $url );

and the get_ok() will fail if the page is fetched, but the resultant HTML
(if it is indeed text/html) does not pass HTML::Lint.

Added $mech->click_ok().

The user agent is now "Test-WWW-Mechanize/version" by default.


1.22    Thu Nov 20 00:33:36 CST 2008
------------------------------------
[ENHANCEMENTS]
Added $mech->head_ok() and $mech->put_ok() methods.  Thanks to
Jaldhar Vyas.


1.20    Wed Mar 12 23:56:11 CDT 2008
------------------------------------
[FIXES]
stuff_inputs() used to do nothing.  Now it works.
http://code.google.com/p/www-mechanize/issues/detail?id=9

Fixed punctuation in some error messages.

Fixed compatibility with WWW::Mechanize 1.36.


1.18    Thu Dec  6 10:12:14 CST 2007
------------------------------------
[ENHANCEMENTS]
Added default descriptions for most test assertions.

[FIXES]
HTML::Lint is now properly optional.

Added delays in all the tests that use HTTP::Server::Simple to give
it time to correctly fire up.


1.16    Mon Oct 29 15:34:21 CDT 2007
------------------------------------
[ENHANCEMENTS]
Added $mech->post_ok().  Thanks, Greg Sheard.

Added $mech->submit_form_ok().  Thanks, Mark Stosberg.

Added $mech->html_lint_ok()

[FIXES]
Fixed some bugs that were causing test failures.


1.14    Fri May 11 16:22:02 CDT 2007
------------------------------------
[FIXES]
Fixes test failures.  Thanks to Mark Blackman for RT #26602:

The module tests currently spawn a server (based on
HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI) which is killed when a __DIE__
signal is received, normally only when the invoking
perl dies. However, as perlvar makes clear, the __DIE__
signal is received when eval blocks die as well. The
new version (1.22) of WWW::Mechanize now calles
HTTP::Message::decoded_content which calls Encode.pm
which has a eval block that require's Encode::ConfigLocal
which is usually not present, so the eval dies and the
HTTP server is killed as soon as the $mech object tries
to do a 'get'. It's simple to use a system variable,
$^S to find out if the __DIE__ signal is being called
for an eval so we ignore that case with the patch
attached.


[DOCUMENTATION]
*   Made the synopsis show that T:W:M doesn't take the tests=>$x
like other Test::* modules.  It'd be nice if it did, though.


1.12    Thu Jul  6 23:47:59 CDT 2006
------------------------------------
[ENHANCEMENTS]
Added followable_links() method to return only those links
that your mech can actually follow.


1.10    Sun Jun 18 22:58:41 CDT 2006
------------------------------------
[FIXES]
RT #19147: Tests turn off the http_proxy environment variable before
starting.  Thanks to Matt Trout.

RT #18779: makes stuff_inputs() conform to the documentation,
changing the implementation to expect an arrayref for $options->{ignore},
as opposed to a hashref.  Thanks to Mike O'Regan.

[ENHANCEMENTS]
Added base_is, base_like and base_unlike.  Thanks to MATSUNO Tokuhiro.


1.08    Mon Nov 21 10:35:23 CST 2005
------------------------------------
[FIXES]
has_tag_like()'s regex was reversed, so would match when it shouldn't.
Thanks to Chris Dolan.

[DOCUMENTATION]
Added links to support sites.


1.06    Jun 29 2005
------------------------------------
[INTERNALS]
Updated test suite to use HTTP::Server::Simple.  Thanks to Shawn
Sorichetti for it.


1.05_02 Sun Apr  3 12:19:05 CDT 2005
------------------------------------
[ENHANCEMENTS]
Added has_tag() and has_tag_like().  Thanks RJBS.


1.05_01 Tue Mar  8 16:24:36 CST 2005
------------------------------------
[ENHANCEMENTS]
get_ok() now shows the status line for the mech if the test fails.

get_ok() now returns true/false, not an HTTP::Response.


1.04    Fri Mar  4 00:08:42 CST 2005
------------------------------------
[ENHANCEMENTS]
Added follow_link_ok().  Thanks to Mike O'Regan.

1.00    Thu Dec  9 11:41:50 CST 2004

Added content_contains()

Fixed diagnostic errors to work the same way regardless of which
version of Test::Builder you have.


0.99    Sun Oct 24 11:17:59 CDT 2004
------------------------------------
[ENHANCEMENTS]
Added $mech->content_unlike and $mech->title_unlike

Made the reporting of where the error happened reflect the caller's
code.
